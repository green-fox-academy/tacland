            </h2>

            <h6>
                All computers run using very low-level commands which do some very basic functions, such as reading data, writing data, jumping
                to addresses, and calculating basic arithmetic. (the complete list of commands that can be run by a CPU is known as that

            <h2>
                Logic gate
            </h2>

            <h6>
                It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more 
                binary inputs and produces a single binary output.

            <h6>
                It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general speed of a system.
                It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical 
                location of data inside the memory.

            <h6>
                A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. They generally consist
                of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.
            </h6>
